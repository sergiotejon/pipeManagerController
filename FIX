[ ]  Normalized pipeline:
    [X] The name of the workspaceDir is empty, Is that correct? If so, should it be removed?.
        "workspaceDir": {
            "name": ""
        },
    [X] Environment variables. Where are the values fields here?
          ...,
          {
           "name": "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
          },
          {
           "name": "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
          },
          ...
    [ ] "volumeMounts": [
        {
           "name": "s3-credentials",
           "mountPath": ""
        }, ...
        And the mount path? It's empty.
    [X] In finish pipeline steps we duplicate volume mounts and even we triplicate them. Maybe we are using a non
    empty slice of volume mounts and we append the new ones. Next an example of the duplicated volume mounts:
          "volumeMounts": [
           {
            "name": "workspace",
            "mountPath": "/workspaceDir"
           },
           {
            "name": "ssh-credentials",
            "readOnly": true,
            "mountPath": "/root/.ssh"
           },
           {
            "name": "workspace",
            "mountPath": "/workspaceDir"
           },
           {
            "name": "ssh-credentials",
            "readOnly": true,
            "mountPath": "/root/.ssh"
           }
          ],
